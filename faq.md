### Seaborn vs Matplotlib?
Seaborn is a high-level library. It provides simple codes to visualize complex statistical plots, which also happen to be aesthetically pleasing. But Seaborn was built on top of Matplotlib, meaning it can be further powered up with Matplotlib functionalities. Best way is to learn Seaborn first, spend some time visualizing with it, understand its limitations. Seabornâ€™s limitations will naturally lead you into Matplotlib.

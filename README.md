Note: something like random forest or decision trees can be used for both continuous and categorical problems

## Supervised Models


## Unsupervised Models


## Stochastic models
### Markov Chains

The main goal of the Markov process is to identify the probability of transitioning from one state to another. This is one of the main appeals to Markov, that the future state of a stochastic variable is only dependent on its present state.
Markov Chains are exceptionally useful in order to model a discrete-time, discrete space Stochastic Process of various domains like Finance (stock price movement), NLP Algorithms (Finite State Transducers, Hidden Markov Model for POS Tagging), or even in Engineering Physics (Brownian motion).
